# TheCube 🟦

**TheCube** is a 3D cube rendering project implemented in C.  
The goal of this project is to create a simple **3D graphics engine** that displays a cube in a window, handles basic transformations, and allows user interaction.

## 📝 Extended Description

TheCube project is designed to teach students **basic 3D graphics programming** concepts:

- **Rendering** – draw 3D objects (cube) on a 2D screen.  
- **Transformations** – rotate, scale, and move the cube using matrices.  
- **User interaction** – handle keyboard or mouse input to control the cube.  
- **Modular design** – separate rendering, input, and math logic for maintainable code.  
- **Math in graphics** – understand 3D coordinates, vectors, and simple projection.  

By completing this project, you gain experience in **C programming, graphics math, and window management**, which form a foundation for more complex 3D projects.
